Put these files into `$HOME/.config`

### Fish
Simple prompt UI config by me

Remember to install `exa` for better list files.

Run these command:
```
set fish_gretting "code what you love, love what you code"
set fish_color_valid_path
fish_config
```

Choose the colors in that config site


### Nvim
Remember to install `vim-plug` and run :PlugInstall inside `$HOME/.config/nvim/plug.vim`

Theme: One Monokai
